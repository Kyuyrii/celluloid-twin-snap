# celluloid-twin-snap
This is just an older version of Celluloid in Snap for anyone who wants to use it because they don't like the changes that happened to Celluloid involving libadwaita.

I just made some modifications to the snapcraft.yaml made by Sameer Sharma.

Here is the link to the original file:
